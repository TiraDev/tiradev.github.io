# -209th BO Launch Anniversary

On this day, 209 years in the future, the historic launch of the Boundless Opportunity took place after its extensive 6-month renovation program from a donated Astrodynamics at the Ferrenel Orbital Manufacturer by the brightest engineering geniuses on Earth, brought together under our banner by the common goal of the scientific wonders that this once hidden planet may bring. Twenty cosmonauts were flown up to the FOM, leaving an enormous crowd behind. A few days later, after making sure the ship was all in order, these brave souls fell asleep, knowing that when they awoke, their family and friends, although alive for the most part, would never see or hear from them again.

Right now in 2021, the year of simultaneous dread and hope, we on the dev team of TIRA have some exciting news to share with you! 
## Community News: 

As you might be able to tell, this blog is the biggest thing that the community team has been working on! We plan on filling up this rather empty website with more content for your enjoyment and information. You may have noticed the social media links in the upper right-hand corner, and although discord (portrayed by the link since Squarespace doesn’t recognize it as social media) is currently the only site we are operating on, we plan on branching out soon! This first blog is relatively small compared to the ones to come as the most important event that’s been happening is the creation of this website, but don’t worry! We’ll have more news for you soon.
